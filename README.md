# JavaGameEngine
## An OpenGL 3D Java Game Engine


This was a minor summer project of mine during the summer of 2016.
With an interest in computer graphics I followed online tutorials, [mostly this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E), which involved creating a game engine in Java using OpenGL. Also designing basic shapes in Blender, and creating basic user input logic.
Unfortunately, all version handling was performed locally and, now after all work has been done, uploaded in one massive commit.
